Test cases:
	1. Employee works with library cards (LC) (data driven test)
		- Search LC: Empty result
		- Create new LC: Successful
		- Update fullname: Successful
		- Search LC: Library card is found
		- Delete LC: Successful
		- Search LC: Empty result
		
(!) My goal is not to show my test design skills, but to show my ability to create autotests for API testing

Developed:
	- Automation UI/API test project (JAVA + Cucumber + Selenide);
	- Allure report with attachments.
